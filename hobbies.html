  <p>Ham Radio is an ever evolving Radio Frequency(RF) communication hobby. Licensed Radio operators,
    can use a wide variety of assigned frequencies, to communicate with other operatiors anywhere from next door,
    to all over the globe. Radio technology has evolved to include Didgital RF communications, by using modes
    like D-Star, DMR, Yeasu Fusion, WinkLink(email over RF), and many more.<br><br>

    WinLink is used extensivly in emergency communications, where there the local communications system has failed. If nromal internet access is not
    working then, a Ham operator can use WinLink to send and recieve email, to a station hundresds or thousands
    of miles away, where internet access IS available and working.<br><br>

    D-Star, DMR, and Fusion, are used to communicate locally, statewide or world wide via the internet. The operator selects
    a server or "room" to connect to. Each orrm has an assigned useage. It can be for statewide communciation, or Region wide,
    or even world wide. An operator in indiana can easily communicate with an operator in Ireland, United Kingdom, Germany, etc.<br><br>

    Analog communcations are still widely used also. Mode used are AM, FM, Single Side Band, Continous Wave(CW, also knows as Morse Code).
    Operators generally collect contacts, to see how may Counties, states, or countries they can contact and recieve confirmation of contact.
    Confmation of contacts, are called QSL's. They were once widely mailed via the postal service, but are mostly done electronically via
    sepcialized servers now, and done electronically.<br><br>

    Ham's are also known for assiting with emergency communcaitions. Helping corrdinate food and supplies to desaster affected areas. Ham's
    also report storm conditions to the National Weather Service, who uses this information to inform the public of potential dangerous Weather.
    After 2 hurricanes hit Puerto Rico in 2017, a group of Ham Radio operators were the first people to get communications up and working, and able to get
    communications on and off the island.

  <p>This is the newest of my hobbies. Im learning how to build a website from scratch. I have had a website at work for 12 years, but i never really
  understood what I was doing, or why it was or was not working properly.  I did a lot of copy and pasting, and modifying code to try and make the
website look the way i wanted it to. For the most part, it worked! Now i am beginning to understand what the html code does and how it is used. Thanks to Udemy
I will be a novice web developer by he end of this class. There are several hours of practice and learing new coding skills to go, but I am enjoying this
 new challenge so far</p>
